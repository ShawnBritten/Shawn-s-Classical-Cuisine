        <li>Remove the giblets (neck, heart and gizzard) from the chicken’s cavity if they are in the cavity. Cut the chicken in half.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and brush butter on chicken. Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a roasting pan that also can be used on a stove to finish the sauce. Roast at 425°F (200°C) for 15 minutes on the middle rack of oven. Add mirepoix around chicken then reduce the temperature to 350°F and continue cooking the chicken to an internal temperature of 160°F. Baste the chicken every 15 minutes during cooking.  If the chicken begins to overbrown, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. (another way of checking if chicken is done is by pressing down on the thickest part of the chicken breast.  If your finger springs up without leaving an impression it is done.)</li>
        <li>When the chicken is done, remove it from the roasting pan and set it aside to rest.</li>
        <li>Place the roasting pan on the stove top and brown the mirepoix. Evaporate all juice until all that is left in the pan is oil. Stir in flour. (If you have a  lot of oil you can remove some.  All you need is 2 T.)</li>
        <li>Deglaze the pan with a small amount of stock. Keep adding the stock until all the stock is in the pan. Lower the heat to simmer and reduce slightly to a nice gravy consistency. (In the industry we call it Nape – translated to coat the back of a spoon.) Transfer the mirepoix and stock to a saucepot through a sieve(strainer)</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasonings.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken in half. Breast on one side thigh and leg on the other.</li>
