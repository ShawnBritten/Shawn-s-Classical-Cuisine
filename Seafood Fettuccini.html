    <h1>Grilling and Fettuccini Alfredo with Homemade Pasta</h1>
    <p>Whether it is scallops, shrimp, or chicken, grilling is a direct heat method that should add flavor to your protein through the searing or charring of the surface of the meat.  It is important to create a surface on the meat or seafood that when done properly, will let go of the pan when it is ready.  With seafood, it generally takes seconds, not minutes.  Remember to always season your protein first before grilling.</p>
    <p><b>Shrimp</b>- They have an automatic temperature done thermometer installed and when they turn pink, they are done generally in seconds.  Any longer, and they will turn to rubber.</p>
    <p><b>Scallops</b>- They have a tendon that needs to be removed if it hasn’t already been done.  Scallops will take just a little longer than shrimp, and it is good to not move them once they have been placed in a medium hot pan.  Once you flip the scallop, you can baste the scallop to completion by using the butter or pan juices to do the job. </p>
    <p><b>Chicken</b> will take longer depending on the thickness. Grill marks on one side, flip and finish on the other side, basting with pan juices to completion.</p>
    <p>Serve immediately!  Which means, your pasta and sauce should be close to completion.</p>
    <p>Today, we will be making homemade pasta in a fettuccini Alfredo sauce, topped with tomato Provençale.</p>
